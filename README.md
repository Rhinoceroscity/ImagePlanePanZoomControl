ImagePlanePanZoomControl
========================

A utility for controlling panning and zooming of cameras for usage with image planes.  Our modelers needed a tool that would allow them to zoom in on certain parts of the model / image plane without moving the camera, since it was set in a way that matched the model perfectly.
